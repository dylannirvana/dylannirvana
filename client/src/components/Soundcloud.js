                 <p>Automatic is the opening track to the racy record titled Anne Boleyn. Dylan Nirvana retells steamy bits of English history with Hard Rock for modern times, Marshall amps blaring. Sick with wit and catchy as the Black Death, the Queen of a Thousand Days loses her head. And so might you.</p>

                I know a girl whose love never runs out of batteries
                She's a regular orgasm factory
                She don't get tired
                She don't get bored 
                She's gotta Pocket Rocket stuffed in her drawer
               
                She's Automatic
                Emmanuelle don't need a man
                As long as she can use her hand
                </p>
                <p>
                Sydney's a girl whose as smart as she looks
                One of the guys
                But she's not a guy and I can tell ya
                Forget the nails
                Forget the tan
                Bohemia never saw such epicurean 
                
                She's Automatic
                When she gets what she wants
                She's democratic
                You can have her it, it doesn't matter
                Pretty girls never know what they want
                </p>
                <p>
                Erin takes me out behind her neighbor's car
                I know she'll go but I don't know just how far
                First she sits
                And the she kneels
                But what I didn't know is that she steals
               
                She's Automatic
                Practically the time
                She's quite an addict
                You can have her it doesn't matter
                Pretty girls never know what they want
                </p>
