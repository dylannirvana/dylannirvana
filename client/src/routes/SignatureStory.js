                    <h2>Dylan Nirvana</h2>
                    {/* Short Bio */}
                    <p>A guitarists revenge on the status quo. At a time when the operative word is "no". Dylan Nirvana and The Bad Flowers is a full heave of the cutlery. </p>

                    <h5 className="subhead" >Classical guitarist turns to classic punk</h5>

                    <p> Bach just wasn’t in the cards. Dylan Nirvana became part of Manhattan’s underground music scene after DJ’ing for the New York Dolls and Gogol Bordello, spinning life-changing vinyl like Raw Power, Ziggy Stardust, The Slider, Velvet Underground’s “green banana”, Three Imaginary Boys and (prophetically) Marquee Moon. </p>

                    <h5 className="subhead" >“A harder early Bowie” - Country Music Awards</h5>
                    <h5 className="subhead" >“New York Punk” - Brockley London Music Festival</h5>

                    <p>The five song EP, Pentagonal Flower with his band Myrrh had circulated in some unexpected places, from Nashville to South London. The following record Anne Boleyn, which was a rock retelling of the famous beheading, was released on Icarian Records (Courtesey of Brunswick Records), to the sound of crickets. But some people were listening, Junkies and intellectuals, unfortunate in both cases. </p>

                    <h5>“Like Elvis Costello. Makes Morrissey sound like Motörhead” - The Village Voice</h5>

                    <p>Part of the Antifolk movement in New York City’s East Village, centering around the Sidewalk Cafe, Dylan Nirvana then performed along side Living Colour’s Corey Glover, Chris Barron from the Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler’s John Popper, Regina Spektor, Lach, Feist, and Nelly McKay at classic venues like Continental, CBGB’s, Pianos, Lit Lounge, Trash Bar, Ottos Shrunken Head, Luna and Mercury Lounge. Somewhere around this time Dylan was brutally reviewed by some idiot at the Village Voice. </p>

                    <h5>“CBGB's Pint Sized Bleached-Haired Punk Rocker” - The Village Voice</h5>

                    <p>One of the last bands to regularly perform at CBGB's before it was shut down, Dylan Nirvana began working closely with Billy Ficca from the legendary band Television, which was one of the first (if not the first) to play there. That new band, The Bad Flowers flew to Texas to record Revolutionary Road. The sessions that were recorded on old school 2" tape were lost in a vat of heroin and may as well have been mistakenly shipped off to Micronesia until they were rediscovered by producer Jim Wirt (Fiona Apple). Dylan Nirvana on vocals and guitar. With Marshall amps and Moog synthesizers, the music is so young and alive. And may actually see the light of day.
