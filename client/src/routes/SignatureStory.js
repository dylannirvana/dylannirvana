                    <h2>Dylan Nirvana</h2>
                    {/* Short Bio */}
                    <p>A guitarists revenge on the status quo. At a time when the operative word is "no". Dylan Nirvana and The Bad Flowers is a full heave of the cutlery. </p>

                    <h5 className="subhead" >Classical guitarist turns to classic punk</h5>

                    <p> Bach just wasn’t in the cards. Dylan Nirvana became part of Manhattan’s underground music scene after DJ’ing for the New York Dolls and Gogol Bordello, spinning life-changing vinyl like Raw Power, Ziggy Stardust, The Slider, Velvet Underground’s “green banana”, Drums and Wires, Three Imaginary Boys and (prophetically) Marquee Moon. </p>

                    <h5 className="subhead" >“New York Punk” - Brockley London Music Festival</h5>

                    <p>Dylan Nirvana with his band Myrrh started performing at classic New York venues like Continental, CBGB’s, Pianos, Lit Lounge, Trash Bar, Ottos Shrunken Head, Luna and Mercury Lounge. And the song KT-88 was heard on college radio during various tours in the US and UK. </p>

                    <h5 className="subhead" >“A harder early Bowie” - Country Music Awards</h5>

                    <p>The five song EP, Pentagonal Flower had circulated in some unexpected places, from Nashville to South London. The following record Anne Boleyn, which was a rock retelling of the famous beheading, was released on Icarian Records (Courtesey of Brunswick Records). </p>

                    <h5>“Like Elvis Costello. Makes Morrissey meets Motörhead” - The Village Voice</h5>

                    <p>Part of the Antifolk movement in New York City’s East Village, centering around the Sidewalk Cafe, Dylan Nirvana then performed along side Living Colour’s Corey Glover, Chris Barron from the Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler’s John Popper, Regina Spektor, Lach, Feist, and Nelly McKay. </p>

                    <h5>“CBGB's Pint Sized Bleached-Haired Punk Rocker” - The Village Voice</h5>

                    <p>One of the last bands to regularly perform at CBGB's before it was shut down, Dylan Nirvana began working closely with Billy Ficca from the legendary band Television, which was one of the first (if not the first) bands to play there. </p> 

                    {/* <p>Their new band, The Bad Flowers flew to Texas to record Revolutionary Road. The sessions were recorded on old school 2" tape and produced by Jim Wirt (Fiona Apple). Dylan Nirvana on vocals and guitar. Billy Ficca on drums. With a 1965 Fender Bassman and Marshall Plexi amps, the "Bloody Finger" distortion pedal and Moog synthesizers, the music is so young and alive. But it is not yet released. </p> */}
